# IBRL Architecture Overview

IBRL stands for **Increase Bandwidth, Reduce Latency** â€” a performance-first initiative within the TivetAI ecosystem.

## Core Layers

1. **Ingress Optimizer**  
   Balances node-level bandwidth load across services.

2. **Latency Controller**  
   Applies adaptive backpressure algorithms to lower response time.

3. **Inference Priority Router**  
   Ensures high-value AI tasks are prioritized at runtime.

## Edge Deployment Strategy

- Dockerized containerization
- Bandwidth-aware scheduling
- Real-time latency monitoring (simulated)

## ðŸ”§ Notes

Future plans include WASM + QUIC integration.
